// master configuration: a position sync armed AT or BEHIND the decode cursor is never
// delivered, one armed a single sample ahead fires at exactly that sample, and a sync
// armed from inside a sync callback fires even when it lies in the block being mixed.
// The chain therefore only dies by arming at or behind the cursor -- the anchor's position
// read racing the mixer thread, a group whose lead rounds to zero samples, or a group
// armed after a late (deferred / watchdog) replay -- and every arm site checks for that.
